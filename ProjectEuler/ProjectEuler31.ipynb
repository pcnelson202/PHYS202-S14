      "To start, we'll need an array with all 0's. It's width is the number of coins we are using, and it's height is the (amount of pence + 1), where the amount of pence is the amount we're trying to create in as many ways as possible. The first column is the amount of ways we can create the row number (amount of pence) with just 1p. This is 1 for all x values since we only have 1 coin to use, and the coin is the size of our row increments.\n",

      "* If the amount we are trying to make is larger than the coin we are observing, there may be new ways of creating the amount. First, we know it must at least be the same amount of ways as we could make the amount without this new coin, so we'll add that number to 0. Then, we shall add the number of ways you could make the amount equal to the row number - the coin value for this same column.\n",

We can still use any of these combinations now that we have one more option, so we'll just add that number. The trickier part is why we can simply add the number from the same column, that is the coins worth in rows above the new entry. It's because these are the final answer to the question \"How many ways can I make x-newestcoinvalue pence out of all the coins <= newestcoinvalue?\" which is the same as the answer to the question \"How many way can I make x pence out of all the coins <= newestcoinvalue, guranteeing that one of them is the newestcoinvalue?\" This also prohibits any combination from being counted twice, since all these solutions must include at least one of the newest coin, while all the other solutions (the ones from [x-1,y]) must NOT include the newest coin."
